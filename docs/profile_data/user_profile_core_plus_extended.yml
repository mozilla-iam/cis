## Starting here are the CORE profile fields

# This is a top level attribute (user_id)
# It contains a `signature` and `metadata` objects in addition to a `value`
# All top level attributes are formatted this way.
# In this case, the `user_id.value` is an immutable, unique value identifying the user. It may not be parsed of made
# sense of.
user_id:
  # The signature can be using different types and algorithms, though this is normally `typ:JWS` and `alg:RS256`
  # Note that there is both `signature.publisher` (must be present) and `signature.additional` (optional, for users
  # generated signatures). The publisher which creates the `signature.publisher` is declared in
  # `metadata.publisher_authority` The signature value is then the base64 encoded JWS, for example. The payload that is
  # signed is the complete top level attribute structure, that is serialized alphanumerically (with `JSON.stringify(x)`
  # or `json.dumps(x, separators=(',',':'))` for example, where `x` payload is `user_id.*` minus `user_id.signature`
